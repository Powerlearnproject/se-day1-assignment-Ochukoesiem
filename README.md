Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of operating systems like Windows
2. Development of Web applications like Mozzila Firefox
3. Development of mobile applications like Loan Apps

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirement- This entails identifying the user need, system features and budget.
2. Design- This entails coming up with the software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation- this entails writing the codes and developing the software to meet the design specification.
4. Testing- This entails conducting various tests to ensure that the software meets the requires standards.
5. Deployment- This entails releasing the sofware to users.
6. Maintenance This entails providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall- This entails sequential approach with dinstinct phases 
Agile- This entails iterative and sequential approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to changes

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer- Responsible for writing codes and developing software solutions. 
Quality Assurance Engineer- Ensures that software products undergoes necessary quality tests and meet the acceptable requirements. 
Project Manager- Oversees planning, execution and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)- These are software packages that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing codes. Examples include Visual Studio Code, Vim, Emacs, Sublime Text etc

Version Control Systems (VCS)- These are software tools that enables tracking changes to source codes and corrdinating work among team members. Example is Git, Subversion among others.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenges
1. Changing requirements
2. Tight Deadlines
3. Low Budget from Client
4. Technical Debt

Strategies to Overcome Challenges
1. Agile Methodologies
2. Effective Communication
3. Prioritization of tasks
4. Regular assessments of project goals and timelines

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing- This entails testing the indiviual components or modules of software. Integration Testing- This entails testing interactions between different components or subsystems. System Testing- This entails testing the entire software system as a whole. Acceptance Testing- This entails testing the software against use requirements to ensure tat it meets user needs.

Importance of Quality Control Quality control measures such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is all about crafting questions and statements to get possibe responses for AI models. Prompt Engineering is greatly important in interacting with AI Models as it helps you to get the best out of them. When your question is clear and specific, AI knows exactly what you want.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt- Tell me the history of animals.
Improved Prompt- Tell me the history of animals, their classification, and habitation not more than 200 words.

The Improved Prompt is more effective as it is strealined abd will help the AI to give an accurate and adequate answer.
